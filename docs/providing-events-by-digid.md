## Overview

Netherlands has chosen to employ distributed data models where possible, there is no single source of truth that contains all test results and vaccinations of all citizens. The vaccination and test processes in the Netherlands therefor require the enrollment of an event in a provider database. As such vaccination, test and recovery events belonging to a person can be recorded in one or more systems.

For test results, people general know where they got tested. However, the place where a person's vaccination is registered is not (generally) communicated to the person and is not always linkable to a location. For example: a hospital worker will likely be vaccinated in their own hospital but not by the hospital staff. Their vaccation registration will end up in the database of the external entity. Similarly, a general practicioner could outsource the vaccination to central health services or vice versa, and one of them will hold the registration.

This process aims to allow a person to gather all their vaccination, test and recovery events in a privacy friendly way.

### Terminology
VEP - Vaccination Event Provider
TEP - Test Event Provider
REP - Recovery Event Provider

### Retrieval from the CoronaCheck apps

The CoronaCheck Android and iOS apps, and the web version (intended for desktop use / home printing) are all able to retrieve a person's events.

## Requirements

In order to be able to deliver vaccination, test or recovery events to CoronaCheck, a data source MUST do the following:

* Provide two endpoints:
  * An endpoint that an app can use to determine if a system contains information belonging to a person.
  * An endpoint that an app can use to retrieve events on behalf of the citizen, e.g. https://api.acme.inc/resultretrieval, according to the specs laid out in this document.
* Obtain a x509 PKI-O certificate for CMS signing events.
  * Use this certificate to sign all data responses.
  * Provide the public key of the X509 certificate to the CoronaCheck system so that signed results can be verified against the certificate.
* Obtain another x509 PKI-O certificate to secure the https endpoints
  * Use this certificate to secure the https end points
  * Provide the public key of the X509 certificate to the CoronaCheck system so that endpoints can be verified by TLS pinning.

## Identity Hash
In order to reliably determine a system contains information about a certain person without revealing who that person is an `identity-hash` will be generated for each individual connected party and sent to the Information endpoint. 

Since only the designated party may check the hmac, a secret `hash key` is added. The `hash key` will be determined by MinVWS and shared privately with the provider. 

The hmac will be created using the following items:

- BSN
- First Name (UTF-8 encoded, including any diacritics, full length, as it appears in the BRP)
- Birth Name (UTF-8 encoded, including any diacritics, full length, as it appears in the BRP)
- Day of Birth (in String format with leading zero)

Notes:
* Do not include the 'voorvoegsel' (infix) field. 
* The Birth Name is the name given by birth and, unlike Last Name, does not change during marriage / divorce. 
* Some providers do not have the Birth Name; if that is the case, please consult with your CoconaCheck liaison so we can customize the hash.

The `identity-hash` can be generated as follows:

```shell
echo -n "<BSN>-<First Name>-<Birth Name>-<Day Of Birth>" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "<hash key>" 
```

For example:
- BSN: 000000012
- First Name: P'luk
- Infix: van de
- Birth Name: Pêtteflèt
- Day of Birth: 01
- Secret Hash Key: ZrHsI6MZmObcqrSkVpea

```shell
echo -n "000000012-P'luk-Pêtteflèt-01" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "ZrHsI6MZmObcqrSkVpea" 
```

Will return: `b8a33227016d1bbff65b050aa12a11bcb352fdde2ebff5ab895213b26c50a183` as the `identity-hash`

Code sample in python:

```python
h = hmac.new(b'ZrHsI6MZmObcqrSkVpea',digestmod='sha256')
h.update("000000012-P'luk-Pêtteflèt-01".encode('utf-8'))
print h.digest().hex()
```


## JWT Tokens
In order to authenticate to the API endpoints mentioned below, each request will contain a JWT token. 

All JWT tokens are signed by MinVWS using a public/private keypair in the 'RS256' format. The public key used by MVWS will provided on a public api endpoint.

Key rollover(s) will be published and communicated at least 2 weeks in advance. The provider should implement a key roll-over mechanism, so that if a new key is distributed, it will temporarily accept both keys, to account for users migrating over a short period of time.

The provider MUST validate the signature in the token. Only tokens signed by MinVWS should be considered by the api endpoint(s).

Example of the generic fields of a CoronaCheck JWT token:

```javascript
{
    "iss": "jwt.test.coronacheck.nl",
    "aud": "api-test.coronatester.nl",
    "identityHash": "47a6c28642c05a30f48b191869126a808e31f7ebe87fd8dc867657d60d29d307",
    "nonce": "5dee747d0eb7bccd22a6bb81e4959906aecd80bd0ebf047d",
    "iat": 1622214031,
    "nbf": 1622214031,
    "exp": 1623423631
}
```

Request specific contents of the JWT tokens are documented in the definition of each api endpoint.

When evaluating the JWT, the API endpoint should check:
* Whether the JWT has a valid signature
* Whether the expiration is in the future (`exp` field)
* Note: if you validate the issuer (`iss`) check only if it ends in `coronacheck.nl` as different prefixes might be used depending on infrastructure changes.

## Protocol versioning

The request to all endpoints contains a `CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version`. This should be considered a content negotiation. The app will always pass the highest version it supports. Providers should however return the JSON responses in the highest version they support.

For example, the app gets an upgrade and supports a new version, `CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version: 5.0`. Providers who haven't upgraded to this new version, can continue to return 3.0 responses (`"protocolVersion": "3.0"`)until they implement version 5 themselves. This way, the app and provider endpoints can be upgraded independently, with the app always having a headstart. The app will continue to support older versions until they are phased out. Information about protocol versions in use can be found in the [migration guide](migration-guide.md).

## Api Endpoints

This chapter explains the endpoints that a provider must implement.

### Information Available 

In order to determine if a person is present in the provider's system a hash is sent to the first endpoint. The identity-hash is included inside the JWT token provided in the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>` header.

#### Request

In `cURL` the request looks as follows:
```
curl
  -X POST
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT TOKEN>'
  -H 'CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version: 3.0'
  -d '{ "filter": "vaccination", "scope": null }'
  https://api.acme.inc/information
```

Notes:

* The useragent will be anonimized.
* HTTP POST is used instead of a GET to aid in preventing logging/caching of the token or code.

**Filtering**

The `filter` is currently required, but we plan to make this optional in the future so providers are encouraged to consider this optional, to save future work. (If left out, the provider would check if they have either vaccination, test or recovery events for this user). 
Allowed values currently are: `vaccination`, `negativetest`, `positivetest` or `positivetest,recovery`.

**Scoping**

The `scope` parameter is an optional extra parameter that provides the provider with a hint to make a subselection of the data. Currently the following scopes will be supported:

Filter      | Scope      | Meaning
------------|------------|---------
positivetest|firstepisode|Provider should return the earliest positive test result for the user, regardless of PCR or antigen test type. This will be used for vaccination completion.
positivetest|mostrecent  |Provider must return the most recent test for the user, regardless of PCR or antigen test type. In addition, if this most recent test is an antigen test, it should also return the most recent PCR test, if present. In that case 2 tests are returned. The rationale is that only the most recent PCR test yields a DCC, while the most recent antigen yields a CTB.

Example usages:

1. User tests positive on may 1st, and has a 1 of 2 vaccination shot on july 1st, then on august 1st they test positive again. To be able to get a complete vaccination based on one jab and a positive test, we need the may 1st test. The august 1st test is >= vaccination date so wouldn't be eligible. For vaccination completion we will therefor use the `firstepisode` scope, which will always return the may 1st case.

2. User has a positive PCR test on may 1st and a positive Antigen test on may 4th. Without scope, the may 4th test would be returned (the most recent test), which would yield only a Dutch CTB. The user also has a right to a DCC however based on the positive PCR test. Therefor when retrieving tests to create a recovery certificate, we will use the scope `mostrecent`.


#### Response

The response (CMS Signed) should be provided as follows:
```javascript
{
    "protocolVersion": "3.0",
    "providerIdentifier": "XXX",
    "informationAvailable": true // true or false if information is available
}
```

#### JWT Token

This request has no additional JWT fields other than the standard set.

### Events Api
If the Information Available api returns `true` the app will follow up with a second request in order to get the actual vaccatination events. This time the JWT token will contain two items, the identity-hash and the actual BSN. The BSN inside the JWT token is encrypted.

#### Request

In `cURL` the request looks as follows:
```
curl
  -X POST
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT TOKEN>'
  -H 'CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version: 3.0'
  -d '{ "filter": "vaccination" }'
  https://api.acme.inc/events
```

The `filter` is currently required, but we plan to make this optional in the future so providers are encouraged to consider this optional, to save future work. (If left out, the provider would check if they have either vaccination, test or recovery events for this user). 
Allowed values are: `vaccination`, `negativetest` or `positivetest,recovery`.

#### Response

The response (CMS Signed) may contain multiple events. The response should be provided as follows:

```javascript
{
    "protocolVersion": "3.0",
    "providerIdentifier": "XXX",
    "status": "complete", // This refers to the data-completeness, not vaccination status.
    "holder": {
        "identityHash": "", // The identity-hash belonging to this person.
        "firstName": "",
        "infix": "",
        "lastName": "",
        "birthDate": "1970-01-01" // ISO 8601
    },
    "events": [
        {
            "type": "vaccination",
            "unique": "ee5afb32-3ef5-4fdf-94e3-e61b752dbed9",
            "isSpecimen": true,
            "vaccination": {
                // Vaccination record
            }
        }, // or
        {
            "type": "negativetest",
            "unique: "...",
            "isSpecimen": true,
            "negativetest": {
                // Test result record
            }
        }, // or
        {
            "type": "recovery",
            "unique": "...",
            "isSpecimen": true,
            "recovery: {
                // Recovery record
            }
        }, // or
        { 
            "type": "positivetest",
            "unique: "...",
            "isSpecimen": true,
            "positivetest": {
                // Test result record
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "vaccinationassessment",
            "unique": "...",
            "vaccinationassessment": {
                // Vaccination assessment record
            }
        }
    ]    
}
```

For the details of the vaccination, test and recovery records, see the overview at https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-provider-docs/blob/main/docs/data-structures-overview.md

There are a few edge cases to consider:
* In case the person is known but events do not exist, the `events` array can be left empty.
* In case the person is known but the events are still processing, the `events` array can be left blank and the `status` field can be set to `pending`. The app will ask the user to try again later. This should be avoided though, the best user experience is if the events are immediately available and the 'information' call matches this state.

#### JWT Token
In addition to the standard JWT token fields documented earlier, the JWT token for the event request will contain:

* `bsn`: The BSN in an encrypted format. 
* `roleIdentifier`: Identifies the role of the requesting entity. CoronaCheck will set this to `01` ('Subject of care'), when the requesting entity is represented by the provided bsn. CoronaCheck will set this value to `02` ('Subject of care proxy'), when the requesting entity is authorized to retrieve events on behalf of the provided bsn and hence not intended for own use. This value can be used by providers for NEN compliant logging.

The encryption of the BSN is done using libsodium public/private sealboxes (X25519). The private key that can be used to decrypt the token must remain with the provider at all times. The public key has to be provided to MinVWS.

### Error states

If an error occurs on the server, a proper 40x or 50x response should be returned. If such an error occurs, the CoronaCheck app will ask te user to try the request at a later time.

A response body may be provided for debugging purposes, but this is optional and the app will not communicate it to the user. 

Avoid including details about your server implementation in the error body (e.g. no stack trace).

The body, if provided, should look like this:

```javascript
{
    "message": "An internal server error occured."
}
```

The following error codes will have a specific message in the app:

* 404 (not found) - The app will tell the user that no vaccination/test/recovery records for this user were found. (Note: this is exceptional, and can only happen for the event query, because if no data was found, the 'information' request would have returned a 200 OK with 'informationAvailable=false'.
* 429 (too many requests) - The app will tell the user that the server is busy and will ask to try again later.
* Any other 40x / 50x errors will lead to a generic error message. 

## CMS Signature algorithm

We are using a CMS algorithm because this is widely available across a large variety of technologies. It is usable from the commandline using tools such as openssl. We may in the future provide libraries and/or off the shelf proxy containers to aid in developing an endpoint. Note however that although the CoronaCheck team may provide samples or ready to use software, the provider remains solely responsible for the test results that are handed out and remain the processor in the GDPR sense.

Note: Add all intermediate certificates to the CMS signature (in order to establish a trust chain).

The signature should use an appropriate signature algorithm and padding; conformant to the current, in-force SOG-IS (https://www.sogis.eu/uk/supporting_doc_en.html) standard. Note specifically that the default padding in OpenSSL (PCSK#1.5) is not considered secure.

The signing looks like this:

```
signature = CMS(PAYLOAD_JSONBYTES, x509cert)
```

The signature must be calculated over the raw json bytes from the response stream.

### Including the signature in the response

The signature and the payload must be wrapped inside a wrapper response. In earlier versions of this protocol we used a header to transmit the signature, but an CMS signature can exceed the maximum header size of some web servers / proxies.

The wrapper contains 2 fields:

* A base64 encoding of the signature, which contains the signature calculated in the previous chapter.
* A base64 encoded version of the (exact) payload.

For example:

```
HTTP/2 200 
date: Sat, 06 Feb 2021 08:52:00 GMT
content-type: application/json
content-length: 145
{
    "signature": "<base64 encoded version of the signature>",
    "payload": "<base64 encoded version of the payload>"
}
```

### Signature verification

The client app will perform the following actions when a signed response is received:

1. Base64-decode the payload to obtain the jsonbytes of the original response.
2. Base64-decode the signature
3. Check if the signature is valid for the jsonbytes of the payload
   4a. If yes: parse the jsonbytes and process the result
   4b. If no: refuse to use the json data and display an error

### Command line example

See appendix 1 for more detailed examples. To try out the algorighm on a Linux commandline, you could use:

```
    openssl cms -sign -outform DER \
                -out content.sig -content response.json \
                -signer mycrt.crt
             
```    

The resulting content.sig can be base64 encoded and placed in the cms-signature header.

The mycrt.crt is a X.509 certificate as issued to the sender by PKI-O. Full example in appendix 1.

### More sample code

More sample code for the signing method can be found in our [Github Sample Code repository](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-tester-signature-demo)

## CORS headers

To be able to retrieve the result from a web browser (the web client for home printing), the following CORS headers should be present on the app token retrieval endpoint:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://coronacheck.nl
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version, Content-Type
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS
```

For acceptance testing, the url is slightly different, so on acceptance test environments, the headers should be:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://web.acc.coronacheck.nl
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version, Content-Type
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS
```

Notes:
* The app endpoint must respect the OPTIONS request (respond with 200 status code) that browsers will perform to check the headers. The OPTIONS request should have the same headers but no body.

## Acceptance to Production

There are a few steps that need to be taken in order to be accepted into the production version of CoronaCheck.

1. Event Provider will submit a request to RDO Beheer (helpdesk@rdobeheer.nl) containing
   - Name of organization.
   - Provider Identifier (3 characters).
   - Production API endpoints.
   - Your libsodium(X25519) public key in base64 format.
   - Contact who will receive the Identity-Hash Secret Key (Email and Phone number).
2. Once your request has been received we reply with
   - The identity-hash secret key in a password protected zip. The password will be communicated via SMS.
   - The MinVWS public key used to encrypt the BSN in base64 format.
3. Provide feedback on when the key will be installed.
4. MinVWS will confirm all contracts are in order.
5. API added to the production configuration by RDO Beheer.

### Generating a Libsodium(X25519) keypair

With PHP:
```php
php -r '$keypair = sodium_crypto_box_keypair(); echo "PUBLIC: ".base64_encode(sodium_crypto_box_publickey($keypair))."\nSECRET: ".base64_encode(sodium_crypto_box_secretkey($keypair))."\n";'
```

With Python:
```python3
import nacl.utils
import base64
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, SealedBox

sk = PrivateKey.generate()
pk = sk.public_key

secret =  base64.b64encode(sk.encode())
public =  base64.b64encode(pk.encode())

print(f"SECRET: {secret.decode()}")
print(f"PUBLIC: {public.decode()}")
```
