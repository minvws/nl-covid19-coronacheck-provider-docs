# CoronaCheck Provider Test Suite

Version 0.4 - 16th November 2021

In the CoronaCheck project we are providing sample test data to Test Providers that we advice the Test Providers contain within their system. Combined with the Test Provider Test Portal, this enables Test Providers to conduct an end-to-end test of their endpoints.

## Test Portal

VWS provides a web front-end through which Test Providers can test their endpoints. Data entered through this web front-end will be sent to a given endpoint and show the response it receives from it.

On the web front-end the user will need to enter:
The TOKEN element of the retrieval code (the Y-part from XXX-YYYYYYYYYYYYY-ZV).
The end-point that the test service needs to address

After the test service has been called, the exact return values will be shown to the user.

A standardized test set has been provided. It is up to the Test Provider to ensure that this data is recorded in their database, such that this VWS web front-end can be used against an existing and known test set.

This Test Portal can be found here: [https://provider.coronacheck.nl/](https://provider.coronacheck.nl/)

### User Interface

The Test Portal contains the following fields:

```
[ URL                                              ]
[ Token                                          ^ ]
[ Verification code                                ] (optional)
```

After providing this information and hitting `Submit` the portal executes the following:

 * It sends a `POST` request to the provided URL
 * The Tokens that a user can select are presented as a drop-down. These are read from the accompanying test data set, that should be included in the Test Providers database.
 * This post request contains the following headers:
   - `Authorization: Bearer <Token>`
   - `CoronaCheck-Protocol-Version: 3.0`
 * And, if a Verification code was provided, the following JSON object is sent as data
   - `{ "verificationCode": "<Verification code>"}`

The values returned from this call are then presented to the user. Next to the returned values, the expected return values are also shown and it is clearly indicated which do not match the expected outcomes.

## Test Data

The data that the Test Provider should maintain in their system can be found in this repository. This data has been provided as a means to conduct end-to-end testing via the above mentioned portal.

How the data is represented in the Test Provider database is up to the implementor of that database.

The data can be found [here](default-test-cases-v3.csv).

### Updating the data prior to testing

The tokens cannot be older than 96 hours. In order to be able to test properly, the `sampleDate` field in your database needs to be updated to something sensible. For testing, we suggest to update the sample dates in the test providers' database prior to using this portal, and set these to `now()`. That way, the test cases will send the appropriate `expectedStatus`. Only the test cases for token `LLBULLBULLBU` and `VSBQVSBQVSBQ` should not be updated. These two tests are specifically focussing on expired and pending tests.

### Submitting new test cases

If you uncover additional test cases, that could be helpful for VWS and / or other test providers -- and as such make this service even more useful, please add these to the [default test cases](default-test-cases.csv) CSV file and create a pull request on this repository.

This also means that it may be a good idea to put a Watch on this repository, as we will be adding new test records as and when we receive them.
